# Eve Online RL Agent Project
In this project, we trained a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play the MMORPG EVE Online. Given the game's complexity and its numerous Player versus Player (PvP) and Player versus Environment (PvE) interactions, we narrowed our focus to mining, which is a simpler PvE part of the game. Our agent was designed to optimize travel time, fuel consumption, resource collection, and the selection of locations for selling resources, all with the goal of maximize how much in-game currency it earned per training episode. Additionally, this repository includes a NeurIPS-style paper detailing our development process and findings.
