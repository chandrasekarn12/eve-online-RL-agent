This is a project we did to train an RL-agent to play the MMORPG EVE Online. Due the complex nature of the game and its many Player verus Player (PvP) and Player versus Environment (PvE) interactions, we decided to only focus on mining, which is a PvE elements of the game. We designed an RL agent to optimize its travel time, fuel consumption, the resources it mines, and the locations at which it sells resources, all in order to maximize how much in-game currency it makes in a specific episode.
